Hi,
I am employee from Wepay. We were tracking PTO and time way using BambooHR. But the data upload from Bamboo to me@jpmc was corrupted, so there are several discrepancies between BambooHR PTO balance and me@jpmc balance:
1, The vacation balance in BambooHR is 178.2 but balance in me@jpmc is 125.78. There is only 1 PTO request in me@jpmc but not in bamboo is the 8 hour PTO on Oct 07, so the actually vacation balance I should have is 170.2. I have attached the screen shot of bamboo hr and me@jpmc to show the difference.  
2, The personal day should be 24 hours but in me@jpmc is 12 hours.
3, the sick time should be 60 hours but in me@jpmc is 88 hours. 
Could you please correct these balances. Thank you very much!
